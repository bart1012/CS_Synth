Application has to consume two native APIs: Multimedia Device API and WASAPI 
Find interface reference GUIDs in microsoft interface headers (.h files)

TO DO:
-add octave picker 
--add portamento / glide: 
--add voice options: mono, poly, arrpegiator, chord 
-- allow second oscillator to be turned on / off
- seperate concerns - Keep MappedSignalGenerator focused only on generating raw waveforms - move filters and effects elsewhere 
-while wasapi is playing,  it will continosuly read from buffer, if buffer source reaches the end, it will automatically be removed -  you cannot retain signals that have not started

---docs:

The final type is the frequency sweep (or 'chirp'). This is a sine wave that starts at Frequency and smoothly ramps up to FrequencyEnd over the period defined in SweepLengthSecs. It then returns to the start frequency and repeats indefinitely

Gain = 0.2, 
Frequency = 500, // start frequency of the sweep
FrequencyEnd = 2000, 
Type = SignalGeneratorType.Sweep, 
SweepLengthSecs = 2
