## Current Updates

The project currently allows for very basic wave generation with additional controls for changing the waveform, octave, and pitch. There's also an additional volume envelope panel controlling the attack, decay, sustain, and release. 
I am currently trying to revise the architecture of the application to make everything cleaner and more modularised.
