## Current Updates

The project currently allows for very basic wave generation with additional controls for changing the waveform, octave, and pitch. There's also an additional volume envelope panel controlling the attack, decay, sustain, and release.

## To-dos

*Revise the architecture of the application to make everything more modular.
*Allow for more control in shaping the generated signal.
*Bind the digital keyboard and click events to voice generators.
